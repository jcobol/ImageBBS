Visual description:
- Commodore 64 text-mode screen with the characteristic deep blue background and lighter blue border.
- Main content area displays Image BBS menu text in light blue characters, arranged in multiple columns of uppercase menu items.
- A solid white reverse-text status bar runs along the very bottom row, contrasting with the blue background.
- The bar is segmented into labelled cells, each showing a macro legend such as "F1", "F3", "F5", "F7", "SHIFT-F1", "SHIFT-F3", "SHIFT-F5", and "SHIFT-F7" alongside the corresponding command titles.
- The inverse-video styling of the bar highlights the active lightbar selection and anchors the macro hotkey terminology for the interface.
