# Design Decisions

## Preservation of experience
- Maintain the original look and feel for both callers and the system operator when interacting with the port.
- Ensure the system remains moddable in the same spirit as the original Image BBS, including support for customization hooks.

## Storage configuration
- Support configuring drive numbers that map to paths on the host filesystem via a configuration file.

## Character set fidelity
- Render Commodore 64 character glyphs so that existing artwork and PETSCII layouts display identically to the original system.
