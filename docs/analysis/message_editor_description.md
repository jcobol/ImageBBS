# Image BBS Message Editor Screenshot Description

The screenshot shows the Image BBS text-entry interface running on a Commodore 64-style display with a blue background and light blue borders. The main status line at the top identifies the current menu as "Main: F" and confirms that the user has opted to leave feedback. Beneath the "Feedback Subsection" banner, the subject field contains the text "IMAGE BBS EDITOR:" followed by an underscore cursor and the word "Test" on the next line.

On the right edge of the subject area, contextual shortcuts explain that pressing `.S` saves the message, `.A` aborts, and `.H` opens help. Below the subject, the editor reports 253 lines available, none remaining, and zero lines currently stored in memory, with 7046 bytes of free memory remaining.

The body area shows a single line of message content: "Testing feedback." A "Command: Text" prompt appears underneath, and the status bar at the bottom records the date and time "Sat Sep 12, 2020 6:35:25 PM" along with the coordinates "-334".
