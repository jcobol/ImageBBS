# Image BBS Configuration Editor Screenshot Description

The screenshot depicts the Image BBS V2.0 Configuration Editor rendered on a Commodore 64-style display with a bright blue background and darker blue border. Two bordered panels dominate the screen. The left panel lists editor modules labeled A through G: "Macros Editor," "Command Set," "Payroll Editor," "Logon Editor," "Access Groups," "File Lists," and "Function Keys." The right panel continues the alphabetical menu from H through N with options such as "Lightbar/Alarm," "Misc. Features," "Modem Config," "Set Time," "System Drives," "Netmail Config," and "Quit."

Each menu item is displayed in capital letters with its shortcut letter highlighted, while the currently selected entry, "Macros Editor," is inverted to white text on a dark blue background to indicate focus. A status bar along the bottom shows the current date and time "Sat Sep 12, 2020 6:36:27 PM" aligned to the center, with the value "-332" at the right edge, consistent with the interface's coordinate readout.
